Fetch/Pull/Merge
Fetch remote tracking branch without merging
git fetch <remote_name>

Fetch the latest upstream from a branch
git fetch <remote_name> <branch_name>

Merge with the upstream that was fetched locally
git merge <remote_name>/<branch_name>

Rebase (Same as merge but without the merge commit)
git rebase <branch_name>

Pulls the latest upstream from remote (Fetches & then merges)
git pull

git pull <remote_name>

git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>

git pull origin master fetches commits from the master branch of the origin remote (into the local origin/master branch), and then it merges origin/master into the branch you currently have checked out.

git pull only works if the branch you have checked out is tracking an upstream branch. For example, if the branch you have checked out tracks origin/master, git pull is equivalent to git pull origin master

Merge without checkout
# Merge remote branch origin/foo into local branch foo,
# without having to checkout foo first:
git fetch origin foo:foo
Branch
List branches
git branch -a

Switch to existing branch
git checkout <existing_branch>

Switch & create new branch if doesn't exist
git checkout -b <branch_name>

Switch to a specific commit
git checkout <commit_hash>

Create new branch from a commit/branch (when current head is at a specific commit / branch)
git switch -c "in-app-messaging-fix"

Clone a branch
git clone -b <branch_name> <remote_repo>

Delete a branch locally
git branch -d <branchname>

Clone a specific branch (skips fetching other branches on this repo)
git clone -b <branch_name> --single-branch <remote_repo>

Delete a local branch
[Non-Force] git branch -d <branch_name>
[Force] git branch -D <branch_name>
Delete a remote branch

or

git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
